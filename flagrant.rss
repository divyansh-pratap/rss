Flagrant is a comedy podcast that delivers unfiltered, unapologetic, and unruly hot takes directly to your dome piece. In an era dictated by political correctness, hosts Andrew Schulz and Akaash Singh, along with AlexxMedia and Mark Gagnon, could care less about sensitivities. If it’s funny and flagrant it flies. If you are sensitive this podcast is not for you. But if you miss the days of comedians actually being funny instead of preaching to a choir then welcome to The Flagrancy. THE GREATEST HANG IN THE UNIVERSE!

Epstein Files Blocked, Trump Cancelled Colbert? & Zohran's Chances in NYC with Ezra Klein
</title>
<description>
YERRR – this one’s a political rollercoaster with Ezra Klein in the building, and nothing’s off limits. From Mike Johnson shutting down the Epstein vote to Trump’s sketchy second‑term plans, Ezra helps the boys connect the dots on conspiracies, power grabs, and why reform feels impossible. They get deep into Project 2025, the rising cost of education, polarization, and why the Democratic Party might need a full rebuild. Plus: social mobility, Mamdani’s policies, and why forming real coalitions is harder than anyone admits. And of course—Colbert getting axed, CBS’s mess, and keeping the pressure on those Epstein files. All that and more on this week’s episode of FLAGRANT. INDULGE. 00:00 Mike Johnson stops Epstein vote + conspiracy 6:45 Trump loves to draw, Panic mode + He knew 12:28 Trump's Watergate? Don't get distracted 17:52 2nd term = all Trump's appointees 23:33 Dems are not reformers + Need for open primaries 31:49 Polarization on institutions + Opportunity for Dems 39:55 Dems keeping their distance + Defined by Mamdani 46:54 Project 2025 + Curtailing colleges 57:30 Need to look at institutions 1:02:26 Rising cost of education + What is it for? 1:13:31 Social mobility & Mamdani 1:19:49 Poirier Holloway was great 1:25:48 de Blasio + Other Mamdani's policies 1:33:06 Free and plentiful + Abundance 1:44:23 Horseshoe Theory + Forming coalitions are hard 2:03:44 Have to acknowledge own failings + Trump trust 2:12:12 My bad with Dave Portnoy 2:17:50 What the new Democratic Party needs to be? 2:31:45 Colbert cancelled + CBS merger 2:47:44 Trump's potential dangerous distractions 2:52:51 Mahmoud Khalil + Weaponization of speech 2:56:33 Keep pressure on Epstein files Learn more about your ad choices.

I sold out Radio City TWICE... and then BILL GATES SHOWS UP, listen now for the whole story. Flagrant 2 is a comedy podcast that delivers unfiltered, unapologetic, and unruly hot takes directly to your dome piece. In an era dictated by political correctness, hosts Andrew Schulz and Akaash Singh, along with AlexxMedia and Mark Gagnon, could care less about sensitivities. If it’s funny and flagrant it flies. If you are sensitive this podcast is not for you. But if you miss the days of comedians actually being funny instead of preaching to a quire then welcome to The Flagrancy. New York native and internationally touring stand-up, Andrew Schulz is known for his hilarious and unsafe comedy. He has starred in the sitcom BENDERS (now available on Netflix), can be seen in Amazon’s SNEAKY PETE, HBO’s CRASHING, and on MTV including GUY CODE and GIRL CODE. In the podcast realm, Schulz can be heard on the wildly popular THE BRILLIANT IDIOTS — co-hosted by nationally syndicated radio and television personality Charlamagne tha God — the hilarious sports commentary podcast FLAGRANT 2, and the film and TV analysis podcast WESTERBROS. He has made major appearances on The Joe Rogan Experience, Bert Kreischer’s BERTCAST, Joey “coco” Diaz The Chuch of What’s Happening Now, and Theo Von’s This Past Weekend. He has even done solo interviews with the likes of Lil Duval and many others. Andrew’s online presence has touched hundreds of millions of people across the globe and his unconventionally funny approach to the comedy world has launched him into stardome. His shows Dropping In and Inside Jokes will rack of hundreds of thousands of views weekly. Nothing is off limits for Schulz, from sex to race, and even the occasional audience heckler roast, Andrew is hungry to be the best. He can be seen in New York City performing regularly at New York Comedy Club and the Comedy Cellar. Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices

Join the Patreon Asshole Army: http://bit.ly/2xQwHYf #Flagrant2 #AndrewSchulz #AkaashSingh #AlexxMedia New York native and internationally touring stand-up, Andrew Schulz is known for his hilarious and unsafe comedy. He has starred in the sitcom BENDERS (now available on Netflix), can be seen in Amazon’s SNEAKY PETE, HBO’s CRASHING, and on MTV including GUY CODE and GIRL CODE. In the podcast realm, Schulz can be heard on the wildly popular THE BRILLIANT IDIOTS — co-hosted by nationally syndicated radio and television personality Charlamagne tha God — the hilarious sports commentary podcast FLAGRANT 2, and the film and TV analysis podcast WESTERBROS. He has made major appearances on The Joe Rogan Experience, Bert Kreischer’s BERTCAST, Joey “coco” Diaz The Chuch of What’s Happening Now, and Theo Von’s This Past Weekend. He has even done solo interviews with the likes of Lil Duval and many others. Andrew’s online presence has touched hundreds of millions of people across the globe and his unconventionally funny approach to the comedy world has launched him into stardome. His shows Dropping In and Inside Jokes will rack of hundreds of thousands of views weekly. Nothing is off limits for Schulz, from sex to race, and even the occasional audience heckler roast, Andrew is hungry to be the best.

</link>
<description>
What up people. It's time we spoke to someone that has had Coronavirus so they can tell us what it's really like. I sat down with comedian Paul Virzi who just overcame the virus. He breaks it down for me in the most hilarious way possible. INDULGE! New York native and internationally touring stand-up, Andrew Schulz is known for his hilarious and unsafe comedy. He has starred in the sitcom BENDERS (now available on Netflix), can be seen in Amazon’s SNEAKY PETE, HBO’s CRASHING, and on MTV including GUY CODE and GIRL CODE. In the podcast realm, Schulz can be heard on the wildly popular THE BRILLIANT IDIOTS — co-hosted by nationally syndicated radio and television personality Charlamagne tha God — the hilarious sports commentary podcast FLAGRANT 2, and the film and TV analysis podcast WESTERBROS. He has made major appearances on The Joe Rogan Experience, Bert Kreischer’s BERTCAST, Joey “coco” Diaz The Chuch of What’s Happening Now, and Theo Von’s This Past Weekend. He has even done solo interviews with the likes of Lil Duval and many others. Andrew’s online presence has touched hundreds of millions of people across the globe and his unconventionally funny approach to the comedy world has launched him into stardome. His shows Dropping In and Inside Jokes will rack of hundreds of thousands of views weekly. Nothing is off limits for Schulz, from sex to race, and even the occasional audience heckler roast, Andrew is hungry to be the best. He can be seen in New York City performing regularly at New York Comedy Club and the Comedy Cellar. Learn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices
